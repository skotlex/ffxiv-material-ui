## DISCLAIMERS
>Installing mods for FFXIV is against the Square Enix User Agreement, and should be done at your own risk __as it could result in an account ban__... However, Yoshi P (the game's producer) has said in interviews that Square Enix cannot see what is installed on your PC, and that there is a grey area for what a 3rd party tool is.
>
>Some mods, like combat trackers, are abused to harass other players. While others have a lewd/illegal nature to them, and so Square Enix must be able to legally ban accounts who use modding for this purpose. However, if you are using mods that act as personal tools only, and are not sharing it publicly, then you are pretty safe to use them. Just don't ever post anything with your character/account name/email when a mod is clearly visible.
