## Intro

There are two kinds, the concepts for each theme are as follows:

1. **Discord**: Discord color with default UI concept
2. **Black**: Targeting modern dark color, Edged UI

## Installing the mod

1. Download and install FFXIV TexTools

***FOR TEXTOOLS, RECOMMEND TO USE THE LATEST VERSION.***

| Program name  | Download page |

2. Back up the following files in advance before you work *(This is a preparation for mode failure)*

Hit [Help → Backup Index Files] menu. 

**Source index-path**: `{Folder with ff14 installed}\game\sqpack\ffxiv`

| File list |   |
|---|---|

4. Enjoy!

## What to do for new FFXIV patches

I recommend making a mod backup, you can do this by selecting `Make Modpack` in the mods menu, selecting every active mod, and hitting create. Before downloading a new FFXIV patch it is safest to hit the `Start Over` option in the TexTools help menu, installing the FFXIV patch, then importing the mod backup you created previously. While these precautions don't always turn out to be necessary, you risk damaging your install if you don't take them.

If this sentence is difficult to understand, please follow the steps below.
1. Hit `[Help → Start Over]`
2. Download new FFXIV patch
3. Hit `[Help → Backup Index Files]`
4. Import Material-UI mod

If you fail to back up the index files for any reason, you can download them from my github. [download link](https://github.com/skotlex/ffxiv-material-ui/tree/master/Discord/Index_Backups)

## Disclaimers

Use of this program is at your own risk. Square Enix does not permit the use of any third party tools, even those which do not modify the game. They have stated in interviews that they did not view parsers as a significant problem unless players use them to harass other players

## FAQ

**Can you change the color of the HP/MP/Gauge bars?**

Not currently. It's not that it is impossible, just not very intuitive. More than anything else, you can't get the color you want perfectly.

**How can I apply the option?**

1. Apply Material-UI(discord or black).ttmp2
2. Download OPTIONS.zip and move to the wanted folder. (ex. ~\OPTIONS\01_Minimap\03_discord-square-minimap)
3. Apply ttmp2 in the folder.

**How do I use Simple job hud?**

It is only possible in simple job hud. Please refer to the following site:
[SQEX simple hud guide](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/blog/002175.html)
