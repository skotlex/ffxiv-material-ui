## DISCLAIMERS
>Using third party tools for FFXIV is against the Square Enix User Agreement, and should be done at your own risk as it __could__ result in an account ban. However, Yoshi-P (the game's producer) has said in interviews that while the official stance on third party tools will always be "no", Square Enix both cannot and do not want to see what is installed on your PC. It is a complicated, grey-zone issue that usually ends in circular arguments and it just never ends.
>
>Some tools, like combat trackers, are abused to harass other players while others have a lewd/illegal nature to them, and so Square Enix must be able to ban accounts who use modding for this purpose.
>
>There are a few rules of thumb when it comes to third party tools.
>* Do not harass people.
>* Do not post your character name visibly in modded screenshots.
>* __DO NOT POST MODDED SCREENSHOTS WITH THE SQUARE ENIX COPYRIGHT INFORMATION VISIBLE__.
>
>Square Enix has a much lower tolerance for nsfw mods and will aggressively take down anything that is not "brand safe"
>
>—
>
><i>The first rule of mods, is don't talk about mods.</i>

## INTRO
Material UI replaces FFXIV's built-in theme (dark-theme)

There are two kinds, the concepts for each theme are as follows:

* **Black**: Targeting modern dark color, Edged UI
* **Discord**: Unsupported until further notice. Please refer to [Issue #232](https://github.com/skotlex/ffxiv-material-ui/issues/232) for more information.

## INSTALL GUIDE
Please refer to a separate [GUIDE page](INSTALL-GUIDE.md)\
**Installation methods include `TexTools` and `Penumbra`, and I recommend Penumbra if you are not an expert or want to use mods more conveniently and safely.**

## OPTIONS
If you download and unzip the OPTIONS.zip file of [INSTALL GUIDE](INSTALL-GUIDE.md/#textools), there is a preview(.png) file in each folder. Look at the image and if there's anything you like, apply it.

## FAQ
Please refer to a separate page that collects questions that people ask often. [FAQ page](FAQ.md)\
**If you're not familiar with TexTool and mods, or if it's your first time, I strongly recommend you read the page.**

## SPECIAL THANKS
