# FFXIV Material UI (Discord/Black)

*※ The document was written using a translator. Please excuse me even if the context is a little strange.*

## Intro

Material UI replaces FFXIV's built-in theme (dark-theme)

There are two kinds, the concepts for each theme are as follows:

1. **Discord**: Discord color imitates the model of the default UI
2. **Black**: Targeting black color, square UI

## Preview

There's also a lot of other things that's changed. Check out the in-game!

## Disclaimers

Use of this program is at your own risk. Square Enix does not permit the use of any third party tools, even those which do not modify the game. They have stated in interviews that they did not view parsers as a significant problem unless players use them to harass other players

## FAQ

**When will the black version be released?**

I'm very sorry if you're waiting for the black version. After the launch of Material UI(Discord), I will prepare for the "Eden Raid". Therefore, I will temporarily suspend development until the middle of August.

**Can you change the color of the HP/MP/Gauge bars?**

Not currently. It's not that there's no way out, but it's not very encouraging. More than anything else, you can't get the color you want perfectly.
